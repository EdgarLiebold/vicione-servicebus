### Removed

- The inherited message-audit contracts, observers, configuration and provider implementations.
  Their useful diagnostic capture capability is superseded by the intentionally incompatible,
  policy-controlled `MessageJournal`; no audit compatibility alias remains.
- The Python policy validator, its policy modules, and its validator self-test suite. They were a
  discarded Team 1 detour rather than imported behavior. Independently valid safeguards move to their
  effective MSBuild or native xUnit/MTP boundary; the validator must not be rebuilt.
- The foreign licence check and the usage telemetry that reported host, bus, rider and endpoint data
  to a hard wired third party address on every bus start, together with their dependency injection
  and public API surface.
- The inert `TypeAttributes.Serializable` flag on the dynamically emitted message proxy and its
  `SYSLIB0050` suppression. The modern serializers are unaffected.
