# ServiceBus A+ coverage campaign — status

## Current quantitative baseline

- 36 fresh, parseable Cobertura reports cover 32/32 loadable product assemblies at commit
  `e0cf987c845154fea81ec27b63592a910aceac37`.
- Aggregate: 79,569/90,165 lines = 88.2482%.
- Branch interval: 79.2182–86.0351%.
- 142 methods exceed CRAP 30.

## Prior iteration closure

The inherited source-review and package-structure change set is closed on the
current worktree. The final Release build completed with zero warnings and zero
errors, and the complete Unit/Architecture profile passed 9,769/9,769 with zero
failures and zero skips.

Provider evidence retained for this closure:

- the six-fixture local matrix passed 402/402 with empty fixture findings, run
  `vicione-285cc34ba452`;
- the standalone SQL Server profile passed 69/69 with empty fixture findings,
  run `vicione-0a7a93d9e1d6`;
- the final RabbitMQ profile passed 31/31 with empty fixture findings, run
  `vicione-5e9fd08c2ca0`;
- RabbitMQ Unit passed 324/324 after the final pre/post quorum-proof and
  concurrent cleanup regressions;
- the package gate rebuilt 31 packages and passed all 18 Developer Journeys,
  four isolated package consumers, and the 30-assembly runtime API comparison.

The final RabbitMQ contract requires an existing durable quorum queue before
publish and rechecks it after a persistent, mandatory, publisher-confirmed
publish without changing routing. Concurrent privileged queue deletion or
redeclaration during or after broker acceptance is an explicit operational
boundary. Concurrent failed sends preserve their original broker causes while a
new topology generation is running. A failed post-confirm check can retain an
already delivered intent, so retry remains at-least-once and can duplicate.

## Active phase

The RabbitMQ phase is complete in the inherited closure. The ActiveMQ phase is complete in the
current change set: 9,788/9,788 Unit/Architecture tests, three targeted real-broker cases, focused
coverage/CRAP, Microsoft test-quality assessment, and final adversarial review are green. Details are
in `active-mq-phase.md`.

The next phase selects the highest remaining product-risk cluster from the exact 142-method global
baseline. A fresh product-wide aggregate will follow after coherent phases; the focused ActiveMQ
report does not claim that the requested global A+ target is reached.
